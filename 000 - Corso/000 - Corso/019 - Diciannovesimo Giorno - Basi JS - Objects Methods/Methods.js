method
. A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.

Do object methods seem familiar? That’s because you’ve been using them all along! For example console is a global JavaScript object and .log() is a method on that object. Math is also a global JavaScript object and .floor() is a method on it.

We can include methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated key-value pairs. The key serves as our method’s name, while the value is an anonymous function expression.
