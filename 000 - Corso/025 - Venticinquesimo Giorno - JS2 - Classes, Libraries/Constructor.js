Dog is the name of our class. By convention, we capitalize and PascalCase class names.

 keyword. In the context of a class, this refers to an instance of that class. In the Dog class, we use this to set the value of the Dog instanceâ€™s name property to the name argument.
Under this.name, we create a property called behavior, which will keep track of the number of times a dog misbehaves. The behavior property is always initialized to zero.
