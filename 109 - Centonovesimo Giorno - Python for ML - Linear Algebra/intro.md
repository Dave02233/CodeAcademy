# What is Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra focuses on the mathematics surrounding linear operations and solving systems of linear equations. While most of us learned about basic linear operations in algebra classes in high school and middle school, “linear algebra” extends these lessons to apply to multi-dimensional data.

The reality is that many engineering optimization problems can be reduced to systems of linear equations, albeit systems with many equations and many variables. By simplifying problems, we can solve for a solution or set of solutions.

## An Example: Traffic Flow

Let's imagine a problem where we can do this. We have a section of town containing four roads and four intersections. We are trying to find the number of cars along the roads in between the intersections and have data about the number of cars departing intersections outside this road system.

To solve the problem mathematically, we can realize that this system can be modeled as a system of linear equations since the number of cars entering an intersection must equal the number leaving an intersection.

This creates a straightforward system of equations:

20 + d = 50 + a  
25 + a = 30 + b  
60 + b = 30 + c  
40 + c = 35 + d  

Now, what if we extend this problem to the entire city of Manhattan? With many intersections and inconsistent data, solving by hand becomes impossible. This is where linear algebra techniques allow us to solve these complex problems.

## Applications of Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is fundamental for data science and has many real-world applications:

- Solving systems of linear equations with many variables
- Efficient computation of linear transformations on large datasets
- Computer graphics and video games
- Machine learning and deep learning foundations

Happy coding!
